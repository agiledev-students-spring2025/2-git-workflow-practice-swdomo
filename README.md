[Apple’s New ‘Game Changer’ iPhone Update Brings Starlink Satellite Access] (https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2025/02/01/apples-new-game-changer-iphone-update-brings-starlink-satellite-access/)

## My Reflection
The new Apple iOS brings forth a major change: introducing Starlink to iPhones. This technology came as a surprise to consumers since Apple kept the project under wraps. While the technology allows users to stay connected in remote areas, it also brings forth outrage amongst users who dislike Elon Musk and his technologies (this was not mentioned in the article, but I've read it elsewhere).

I am from a mountain town where my friends and I will travel into the backcountry for skiing, biking, climbing, and other activities. When out of cell service, we do not rely on our cellphones to get help. We have radios and special satellite devices that help with remote rescue. There is already technology that helps keep us connected, so do we really need Musk's technology? Also, if this is revolutionary technology, why did Apple keep this under wraps?
